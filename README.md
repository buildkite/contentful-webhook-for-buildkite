# Contentful Webhook for Buildkite

A [Contentful](https://contentful.com/) webhook endpoint that creates [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/) builds based on content events.

Your builds will be created with two pieces of meta-data:

* `type` - such as `Entry`, `ContentType` or `Asset`
* `action` - such as `publish`, `save`, etc.

You can use these to trigger a site build + deploy, for example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -euo pipefail

content_type=$(buildkite-agent meta-data get 'type')
action=$(buildkite-agent meta-data get 'action')

if [[ $content_type == 'Entry' && $action == 'publish']]; then
  # Build and deploy
fi
```
